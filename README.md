# 🌙 Arabic Poetry NLP Search Application

This project is an **AI-powered Arabic poetry search system** that applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to understand and retrieve poetic text based on meaning, context, and emotion rather than simple keyword matching.

The application demonstrates how NLP can be used to process Arabic literary content and improve search accuracy through semantic analysis.

## 🧠 Project Idea

Traditional Arabic poetry search systems depend on exact keyword matching, which limits their ability to capture the true meaning and emotional depth of poetic language. This project addresses this problem by using **NLP-based semantic search**, allowing users to search for poems using ideas or emotions instead of exact words.

The system supports:
- **General Arabic poetry search**
- **Specialized search for Badr’s poems** with emotion and category filtering

## 🔍 NLP Techniques Used

- Text preprocessing and normalization for Arabic language
- Sentence embeddings for semantic representation
- Semantic similarity matching between user queries and poems
- Basic emotion and category classification
- Context-aware retrieval instead of keyword-based search
